## April 20–26, 2024

My notes are a bit shorter this week, in part because I kicked off a new freelance project and I'm not sure yet if (or how much) I'll be writing about it here.

Also, I got sick on Tuesday and wasn't feeling great for the rest of the week, so I wasn't super productive.

### WebAssembly from the Ground Up

- Continued working on adding Ohm content to the "Comparisons, Conditionals, and Loops" chapter. One thing I'm not sure about is whether we want to implement both an expression form of `if` _and_ a statement form. WebAssembly's `if` instruction requires a result type, so we definitely want to implement `if` expressions. So I started with that, and if the chapter isn't too long, maybe we'll implement `if` statements as a "one more thing" at the end.

- Set up an uptime check for [wasmgroundup.com](https://wasmgroundup.com) using Max Rozen's [OnlineOrNot](https://onlineornot.com/). No issues so far, and so far I love OnlineOrNot — it's simple, affordable, and has a great UI.

### Other stuff

- Made a bit more progress on my rasterizer, continuing on [Chapter 7: Describing and Rendering a Scene](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/10-describing-and-rendering-a-scene.html) of _Computer Graphics from Scratch_.

- I'm experimenting with using [Anki][] for Rust and graphics/geometry knowledge. I've used it before for learning German, and have been inspired by [Andy Matuschak][] and [Michael Nielsen][] to try it for other things.

  So far, I'm finding it very useful. For Rust, I'm mostly using it to remember syntax, method names, etc. that I would otherwise have to look up. And it's not a unique observation, but I really do find the that process of deciding on and writing the prompts is very valuable on its own.

- I watched Raph Levien's [High Performance Rust UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVUTZlNCb8U) talk, about the goals and vision for the [Xilem][] project. I've been idly following this work for a while, and chatted with Raph about it a few weeks back. But it's even more relevant for me now that I'm actively working in Rust and writing my own rasterizer :-)

  I'll be at RustNL in a few weeks, where Raph is doing a [talk about the current status of Xilem](https://2024.rustnl.org/speakers/#raph). So I'm looking forward to that!
