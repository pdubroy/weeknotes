### WebAssembly from the Ground Up

- Started a new chapter this week: Imports and Global Variables. This covers content that was originally planned for earlier chapters, but we felt that it made those chapters too long.
- As in previous chapters, I was a bit unsure about the best order to present things. I would have thought that we’d settle on having a similar structure each chapter, but I’m finding that the best order to present things depends on the specific content. Sometimes it makes sense to go top down, explaining the grammar, the semantics, and then the low-level module construction. And other times it makes sense to explain things in a different order.
- Overall, I made some good progress on the chapter and expect to have a draft ready in the next couple of weeks.

### Other stuff

- For an upcoming project, I’m brushing up my skills in 3D geometry and graphics. To some extent, this is about reactivating knowledge that I haven’t used in a while: my work at Lyft on mapping was all about 3D geometry, but that was more than four years ago. But I’m also trying to build a stronger knowledge of the fundamentals that I never really learned before.
- One resource that I’ve found really useful so far: Cem Yuksel’s lectures on YouTube. Cem is a professor at the University of Utah, and he’s made the lectures available for two of the courses he teaches: [Introduction to Computer Graphics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLplnkTzzqsZTfYh4UbhLGpI5kGd5oW_Hh), and [Interactive Computer Graphics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLplnkTzzqsZS3R5DjmCQsqupu43oS9CFN).
- I also spent a few hours pairing with Kevin L., reading the source code for [Truck](https://github.com/ricosjp/truck), a new CAD kernel (geometry library) written in Rust. That’s been helpful to get a better understanding of [b-rep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation), which is the most common object representation used in CAD tools.
- Finally, I decided to write a toy software renderer in Rust. So far, I’ve been following [Dmitry Sokolov's tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki), and yesterday I managed to implement Bresenham’s line drawing algorithm. Next step: rendering triangles!
- Other resources I've found helpful: [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-computer/9781482229417/) by Marschner and Shirley; Gabriel Gambetta's [Computer Graphics from Scratch](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/).
